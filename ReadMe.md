# Draws.CLI

This is just a repo to help organise some reusable stuff for CLI programs so that I don't have to rewrite everything all the time âœŒ

## Idea

The idea of this project is to provide an interface for commands and some attributes for creating your own commands, which can then be given to the commandline parser that in turn parses the arguments and runs the appropriate commands.

## Future

I'd like to implement some features regarding menus or so, kinda similar to [github's CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) or npm where it lets you pick alternatives if you haven't provided them initially.
Not promising anything though since I might just abandon this project in the future.
